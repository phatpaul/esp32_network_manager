This is a component for E\+S\+P-\/\+I\+DF projects. It mainly aims to provide a stateless interface for setting, querying and maintaining the network configuration. Additional features are wrappers around the W\+PS and AP scanning interfaces, as well as a fall-\/back mechanism for when a newly set Wi\+Fi configuration turns out to be unusable for connecting to a given AP.

\doxysection*{Rationale}

Due to the E\+S\+P-\/\+I\+DF\textquotesingle{}programming model one has to keep track of the various events generated by the Wi\+Fi and networking subsystems. This makes it hard to query or modify the networking configuration through a (mostly) stateless user interface provided by, for example, a web server.

Another pitfall is that users might lose access to the device by setting an invalid configuration (as in a mistyped password or S\+S\+ID). In this case the Wi\+Fi Manager module will fall back to the previous configuration instead.

There are also some convenience wrappers around the AP scanning and W\+PS functionalities.

\doxysection*{Usage}

Copy or clone this repository into a directory under your project\textquotesingle{}s \textquotesingle{}components\textquotesingle{} directory. You should now find the menu \textquotesingle{}Wi\+Fi Manager\textquotesingle{} in the \textquotesingle{}Component config\textquotesingle{} menu. Enable the \textquotesingle{}Wi\+Fi Manager\textquotesingle{} option and enter the sub-\/menu. Here you can configure if the manager should run as a dedicated task or utilise the global timer queue. You can also change the compiled-\/in default configuration when the E\+SP is in AP or A\+P+\+S\+TA mode.

N.\+b. If you choose a timer queue based configuration, it might be necessary to increase the timer task\textquotesingle{}s stack size.

The Wi\+Fi Manager module must be started by calling the function {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{wifi__manager_8h_a908df21269b51cfc2152f28d85145867}{esp\+\_\+wmngr\+\_\+init()}}} from your main project, after the N\+VS, default event loop and T\+CP adapter have been initialised. From here on the Wi\+Fi Manager will manage all the networking configuration and changes should only be made via the provided {\ttfamily esp\+\_\+wmngr\+\_\+$\ast$()} functions.
